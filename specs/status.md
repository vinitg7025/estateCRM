## Summary

**11estates CRM** is an internal CRM for 11 Estates (Mumbai), SaaS-ready later. It ingests property ads from newspaper and
WhatsApp extractor files, lead exports and manual entry; classifies them with a controlled deal vocabulary; deduplicates;
runs supply and demand journeys (life curve, call queues, sourcing, proposals, deals); matches demand to supply through
the **CRM Engine**; publishes to the 11estates.in website through a Listings API; and answers questions in a chat-first UI
grounded only in its own data.

Stages 1–6 of the CLAUDE.md pipeline are approved. Stage 7 runs the 87 tasks in `docs/05-tasks.md`, with service tracks in
parallel on the local stack. Cloud provisioning (Supabase, Vercel, Google OAuth, Hugging Face) is deferred to a joint session
after implementation (`docs/runbooks/provisioning.md`).

**Foundation docs:** this project was founded through the CLAUDE.md stage pipeline, not `/start-project`. Charter
equivalent: `docs/01-brd.md` (BRD v0.6.1). Requirements: `docs/02-prd.md` (PRD v0.6). Roadmap equivalent:
`docs/05-tasks.md`. `specs/vision/` and `specs/planning/roadmap.md` are intentionally not duplicated.

## Completed Phases

## Active Phase

| Phase | Branch | Status | Progress |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| Stage 7 — Execution: Foundation track (F-01…F-17) | `task/<ID>-<slug>` per task, PRs #2–#19 | done except F-07 (deferred provisioning) | 16 / 17 foundation tasks |
| Stage 7 — Execution: records, journeys, crm-engine tracks | `task/<ID>-<slug>` | in progress (parallel) | 0 / 30 |

## Upcoming Phases

| Phase | Name | Status | Key Deliverables |
|-------|------|--------|-----------------|
| Stage 7 | intake track (INT-01…11) | planned | Uploads, strict/mapping modes, AI for leftovers, anonymiser |
| Stage 7 | listings track (LIS-01…07) | planned | Publication ceiling, privacy scan, public API |
| Stage 7 | insight track (INS-01…07) | planned | Dashboards, chat, exports |
| Stage 7 | web track (WEB-01…09) | planned | Chat-first UI, sign-in, gateway |
| Stage 7 | Test & release (QA-01…03, REL-01…03) | planned | E2E scenarios, pilot, paid gate, load test |

## Blockers

| ID | Description | Severity |
|----|-------------|----------|
| B-1 | Cloud provisioning deferred by the product owner until after implementation (Supabase ref `tkbaakabwolgjnpdvwjs` exists; it replaced `xzizchbnejzxkhemmpie` on 2026-09-30). Blocks QA-02 (pilot deploy) only. | low |

## Critical Items (P0)

| _(none)_ | | |

## Next Actions

1. Service tracks running in parallel: records, journeys (critical path), crm-engine. Next: intake, listings, insight; then web.
2. Then the service tracks in parallel (≤ 3 at a time): records first, then intake and crm-engine, and so on.
3. The provisioning session with the product owner, then QA-02 pilot deploy and QA-03 benchmarks.

## Key Decisions Made

- Six capability services + edge BFF, with the matching service named **CRM Engine** (ADR-0001).
- Phase 1 on Vercel + Supabase (Mumbai) with a free-plan pilot and a paid-plan gate (ADR-0002, ADR-0008, CR-005).
- Outbox + pgmq event bus (ADR-0003). AI: rules first + Hugging Face open-weight models on redacted text; the model plans, the service executes (ADR-0004, CR-004).
- Controlled deal vocabulary shared with Vinit's extractors (BRD v0.6 §4.2, CR-003). Upload schema = the 89 extractor columns (CR-006).
- Stack: TypeScript 6, Node 24, Next.js 16, Hono 4, Kysely, Zod 4, Vitest 5 (Stage 6).
- Stage 7 runs service tracks in parallel, without stopping for questions (Stage 6 D-10, `docs/06-questionnaire.md`).

## Recent Changes

- 2026-09-27: Stages 4–6 approved. Questionnaire answered. Local tools installed (Node 24, pnpm 12, Terraform). Push permission granted.
- 2026-09-24: Stages 1–3 approved. CR-001 withdrawn. CR-002…CR-006 approved.
