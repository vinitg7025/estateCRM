Environments:
- Supabase pilot project: `estatesCRM`, ref `tkbaakabwolgjnpdvwjs` (`https://tkbaakabwolgjnpdvwjs.supabase.co`, ap-south-1 Mumbai, Postgres 17), created 2026-09-30. It replaces the first pilot project `xzizchbnejzxkhemmpie`, which is no longer used. Linking, bootstrap and deploy happen in the provisioning session (docs/runbooks/provisioning.md).
- Vercel: one project `estatecrm` (Vercel Services, CR-013) in team "Vinit G's projects"; production domain `estatecrm-navy.vercel.app`.

- [x] F-09 libs/outbox: typed transactional outbox write, relay (SKIP LOCKED, atomic fan-out to pgmq), event drains (processed_events dedupe in the handler transaction, backoff via visibility timeout, DLQ after 5), work drains, DLQ replay, retention purges; platform bootstrap extended with private work queues (32 queues) + queue-argument wrappers; `contracts/generated/event-topology.json`; 9 integration tests on real pgmq (2026-09-27)

- in progress (parallel agent): F-14 libs/redaction
- [x] F-11 libs/auth: contract-driven authenticate middleware (staff JWT + header/claim match + x-roles, service tokens + x-callers, cron secret, website API key hook), principals, tenant/role re-checks (other tenant → 404), service-token client with caching; libs/http gains per-operation middleware + effective security; 11 tests (2026-09-27)
- in progress (parallel agents): F-12 libs/observability, F-17 synthetic data
- [x] F-14 libs/redaction: redact/restore/detect with PHONE/EMAIL/URL/NAME/UNIT/ID, placeholder maps kept in memory only, residual-risk post-check; 0 leaks on 171 annotated synthetic ads, 50 hard negatives untouched (2026-09-27, PR #12)

- [x] F-16 Backups and runbooks: nightly encrypted per-schema pg_dump + queue export to the private Mumbai `backups` bucket (14 days) and a monthly restore check (workflows dormant until BACKUPS_ENABLED at provisioning); backup/restore round trip tested locally (owners, grants, queue messages); `dlq.mjs` and `rotate-db-password.mjs`; runbooks deploy, rollback, rotate-secrets, dlq-replay, restore (2026-09-27)

- [x] Foundation addendum (part of each *-01 task): service runtime scaffold for the 6 backend services via `tools/scaffold-service.mjs` (composition root, env config, local server, Vercel entry, platform relay/drain/jobs endpoints in the contract's response style, job leases, 0001 technical tables, platform tests); libs gain app-level middleware, principal ids in request metrics, relay lag, client correlation IDs; service CI builds deps via turbo with local Postgres (2026-09-27)
- [x] F-17 Synthetic data: seeded 89-column extractor-format generator (vocabulary-valid, profile distributions, splits/repeats, error injection with manifest), synthetic-only contacts (`isSyntheticPhone` guard), NDJSON/CSV/XLSX streaming writers, `pnpm synth`; 88 tests; ~95k rows/s NDJSON (2026-09-27, PR #18)
- Foundation complete except F-07 (provisioning, deferred to the joint session by the product owner).
- in progress (parallel service tracks, B6 max 3): records (REC-01…12), journeys (JOU-01…11, critical path), crm-engine (ENG-01…07)
- All 7 tracks merged to main on 2026-09-28 via each stack's top PR after green CI: crm-engine #21 + #31, records #39, journeys #38, intake #58, listings #56, insight #61, web #71 (intermediate PRs closed as included). Follow-up fixes #73 (job lease release), #74, #75 (test flakes). Repo made public by the product owner so CI minutes are free.
- All 7 tracks are code-complete (WEB-09: 369 unit tests, 38/39 Playwright E2E, axe WCAG 2.1 AA clean, gateway overhead p95 10 ms).
- next: QA-01 end-to-end acceptance on merged main → provisioning session (F-07) → QA-02 pilot → QA-03 benchmarks
